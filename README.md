# yechblog
My English is so terrible,but I will try my best to introduce the small project clearly.
This small project is based on Struts2 Hibernate4 and Spring4 and I named the project yechblog.Yes,it's a simple blog.
Because I has been studied the 3 frames recently and I can not use them expertly.Sure,some powerful functions in these frames are also away from me.But I used all my known and solved problems by google and baidu,I try myself to achieve basic functions and added some characteristic functions so that we can see the small blog now.^_^
The blog's pages were based on Bootstrap,because I was not good at pages' beautify,I just copyed some useful css code on my requisite place.
From the blog coding,I learnt the simple using about JavaMail because I used it to vertify the registers.And also I get some knowledge about web editor such as xhEditor and ckeditor.furthermore,I know how to highlight the various code in web editor.And I has knowed the differents between Http's request and ajax request...
en,I can not say more because my english is truly terrible,if you are interested in my blog,you can visite the http://114.215.92.22:8080,I don't have a domain name so far...
